    <h2>Past Projects</h2>
    <strong>ARM CPU Architecture:</strong> <br/>
    <box>
        Studying the ARM CPU architecture through Assembly programming and Verilog behaviour modelling (part of academic coursework). The final result of the laboratory portion of the course produced a single-cycle processor that can execute LEGv8 instructions (a modified ARMv8 instruction set).
    </box>
    <p/>

    <strong>Singularity:</strong> <br/>
    <box>
        Testing and documenting the usage of the Singularity container platform for researchers as an unprivileged alternative to Docker. The software is able to run Docker containers without requiring root access, the user being part of a group that is able to gain root access, or using a privileged daemon. It maintains the users UID inside the container and does not allow the usage of setuid binaries.
    </box>

    <strong>Kerberos-Authenticated Printing with CUPS:</strong> <br/>
    <box>
        Authenticating for printers belonging to an SMB printer share from Linux workstations with Active Directory user logins.
