## Introduction
My name is William Luke. I'm a computer engineering student at Texas A&M University. I enjoy
distributed systems projects, exploring different operating systems, cartography, and playing fetch
with my cat. I want to share more about things I find interesting or challenging with the world
so that others can learn from them too. 

## What Am I Up To?
- Learning Rust
- Developing a kernel for my operating systems class this semester
- Working as a research assistant in the Real Time Distributed Systems lab at Texas A&M
- Thinking about side projects to keep my Go skills sharp
